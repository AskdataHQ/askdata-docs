# Overview - Sales Growth
Sales growth is a metric that measures the ability of your sales team to increase revenue over a fixed period of time. Without revenue growth, businesses are at risk of being overtaken by competitors and stagnating. Sales growth is a strategic indicator that is used in decision making by executives and the board of directors, and influences the formulation and execution of business strategy.

It’d be hard to overstate the importance of the sales growth metric because it is tied directly to revenue and profitability. Growth is the drumbeat by which all organizations march. When performance declines, pressure mounts on the sales organization to deliver results. Conversely, a high percentage growth in sales is cause for optimism for all stakeholders such as executives, the board of directors, and shareholders.

## Key Indicators for Sales Growth

A negative sales growth percentage over the specified time period

## Key terms
Current sales revenue: The total dollar value of sales during the current time period.
Previous period sales revenue: The total dollar value of sales during the period time period.

##Why is the Sales Growth metric important?
Sales growth is one of the most powerful measures available. Sales numbers and achieving monthly, quarterly, and annual growth are all on everyone's mind. The sales growth measure is fascinating since it may serve as a rallying cry for your entire organization.

By striving towards a certain organizational goal, such as a certain percentage increase in revenue. At each level of your sales force, you can create a cascade of interdependent metrics. The revenue and sales leaders, for example, will be in charge of that high-level goal, while directors and managers will be focused on operations directly under their authority. While leaders may keep track of sales growth, the average sales rep does not, directors may also track the metric by rep, and reps may track his or her quote-to-close ratio.

Role	Metric
Executive	Revenue Growth by Quarter
Director	Sales by Region
Managers	Sales Revenue Per Hour; Missed Sales Opportunities; Sales Cycle Duration
Reps	Conversation to Appointment; Sales Quota Attainment
Using the sales growth metric to lead your team
The sales growth metric acts as a rallying call for your entire business but lacks the specificity your frontline reps and account managers need to do better at their jobs. As the table above shows, the cascade of metrics that follow from sales growth can bring clarity and focus to sales activities throughout your team.

How best to lead your team with these metrics? 
The answer is to make performance metrics visible to everyone on your team. Whether you do that with Google Sheets, PowerPoint, Excel, or Salesforce Dashboard is up to you.

Example of a Sales Growth Data Card:
Here’s an example of a sales dashboard using the growth metrics as the central metric. The dashboard reports on metrics on a monthly basis and uses targets to demonstrate how everyone on the team contributes to the achieving the business target.
