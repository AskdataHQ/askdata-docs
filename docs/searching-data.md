Search
------

Users can **query the data** at any time through the search bar. The Agent searches across all data to answer the questions. The cards provided by the Agent can be saved and shared as stated before.  


In order to enable users to quickly find and select the information they need, when the user is typing the query system provides useful suggestions like most **frequent queries** similar to the ones the user is writing (drop-down menu) and the **autocomplete** of the query with the entities the system is aware.

* **Save Query**: save the query that produced the card as an answer.
