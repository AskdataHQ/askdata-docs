## Feeds

A Feed is a curated group of Askdata [Data Cards](/docs/what-is-a-datacard). You can create your own Feeds or follow Feeds created by others. Viewing a Feed timeline will show you a stream of Data Cards from only the accounts on that List.

Users can create **public** or **private** Feeds. 

Public feeds are created by a user without security constraints. Public feeds can be seen, searched and followed by other users. 
Private feeds are visible only to the users who created them and to the owner has set in the security setting of the feed.

To **create** a new feed, from the Home:

* click the â€œFeeds" button 
* then click on "Create feed"
* fill the form with the new feed Name, and select the associated Icon
* choose the Visibility level (public or private) and the autofollow property  

If the autofollow property is set to "yes" the new Feed is automatically followed from all the users, if "no" only the users that search for can follow it
