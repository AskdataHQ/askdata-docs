## Main features:

#### Natural Interaction:

AskData uses modern AI and knowledge graph techniques to help users to surface useful answers proactively organized in modern feeds.

#### Index data from all your datasources:

Askdata provides state-of-the-art tools for indexing data dimensions and metrics from many disparate operational datasets.

#### Automated Configuration:

Users can begin asking questions about their connected data instantly using AskData’s patent-pending natural language querying technology — no training needed.

#### Secure:
Askdata administrators can define precise security rules for accessing data sets, fields, and even records, so that users only have access to authorized information at all times.

#### Instant Connect:
Modern organizations have data, stored in disconnected systems and in confusing structures and formats. We let people who rely on this data to make decisions don’t think in terms of queries, joins and data types.
