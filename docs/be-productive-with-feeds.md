Feeds (3)


Feeds are containers of cards that are used to **organize** according to business logic chosen by the users themselves. Each user can **create feeds** and save cards in them. 

Users can create **public** or **private** feeds. Public feeds created by a user can be seen and followed by other users. Instead, private feeds are visible only to the user who created them.
