## Feeds

A Feed is a curated group of Askdata [Data Cards](/docs/what-is-a-datacard). You can create your own Feeds or follow Feeds created by others. Viewing a Feed timeline will show you a stream of Data Cards from only the accounts on that List.

Users can create **public** or **private** Feeds. 

Public feeds are created by a user without security constraints. Public feeds can be seen, searched and followed by other users. 
Private feeds are visible only to the users who created them and to the owner has set in the security setting of the feed.
