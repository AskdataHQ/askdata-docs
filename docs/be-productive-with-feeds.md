## Feeds

A Feed is a curated group of Askdata [Data Cards](/docs/docs/what-is-a-datacard). You can create your own Feeds or follow Feeds created by others. Viewing a Feed timeline will show you a stream of Data Cards from only the accounts on that List.

Users can create **public** or **private** Feeds. 

Public feeds created by a user can be seen and followed by other users. Instead, private feeds are visible only to the user who created them.
