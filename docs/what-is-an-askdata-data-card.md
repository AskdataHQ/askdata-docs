    ### Data Cards

Data Cards are the information units that the system provides to users. They can be generated on demand by asking, searched, or automatically generated by rules.

Data Cards can be generated when users search or ask something to an agent or schedule the creation of a Data Card rule. Data Cards are composed by several different components that can be recombined using machine learning or a useful graphical interface
