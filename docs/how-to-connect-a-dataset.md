## Dataset Configuration process:

Open **Askdata** [https://askdata.com/agent](https://askdata.com/agent) and select the agent that you want to manage.

Open the *Datasets* section.

Click on the [+] button close to the **Dataset** and select the dataset type you want to connect.

Askdata natively supports different datasets: [list of supported dataset](https://www.askdata.com/datasets)

Once the new dataset is added, you can keep editing\configuring the different section.

A *Dataset Admin* can edit the following sections:

In the left menu there's the “Connection” tab that can be used to establish a connection with data source.

Once you have completed you can simply press *Save*. Askdata will discover the dimensions (entities) and measures and build a knowledge graph that can be extended with synonyms and entity relationships over time.
