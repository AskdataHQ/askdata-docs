Existing Analytics tools require technical knowledge for people to access and analyze data, which limits the daily use of data for most employees. Askdata Web App: Askdata brings the easiest way to find answers to questions. Simply ask questions and get your answers in your everyday language whenever you need to. 

**How to get the Askdata Web App:**

Once the service team activates your instance you will be able to use the web application to search for your data.
