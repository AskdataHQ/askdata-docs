### Agent Creation:

To create an Askdata agent you can use the **web app**: <https://app.askdata.com>. From the home (click on the Askdata icon) you can select the "Create Workspace" button.

Through the **web app**, editors can create new Agents and configure them.  

Also the end users (Viewer) can connect to the web **App** at <https://app.askdata.com>. Using the web client or the native Apps for Android and iOS, users query the Agent and access the published content but cannot modify the agent configuration.
