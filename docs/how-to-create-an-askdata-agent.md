### Console Access:

To create an Askdata agent we suggest to use the web admin **console**, connect to the site<https://console.askdata.com>.

Through the console, editors can create new Agents and configure them.  

End users (Viewer) connect to the web **App** at <https://app.askdata.com>. Using the web client or the native Apps for Android and iOS, users query the Agent and access the published content but cannot modify the agent configuration.
