    **pandas** is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,  
built on top of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.

When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, Pandas is the perfect tool. Pandas helps to explore, clean and process your data. In Pandas, a data table is called a [DataFrame](/docs/what-is-a-dataframe).
