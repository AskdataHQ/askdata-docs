    A chatbot is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to stimulate human conversation. Chatbots are used via messaging interfaces. A chatbot works using either a set of guidelines or by using machine learning. Chatbots that use a set of guidelines is able to respond to only a specific set of questions. Once the person interacting with this chatbot get to the final question, the chatbot is no longer able to engage. A chatbot that uses machine learning, on the other hand, is able to intelligently continue to engage with the human on the side of the interaction until it concludes that all of this human’s inquiries have been answered. Chatbots that use machine learning are able to improve by learning from each conversation and taking that new insight into future conversations.
