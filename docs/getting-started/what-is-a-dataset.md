    The Askdata platform improves the way people interact with data.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataset) a dataset is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column of a table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given record of the data set in question.

We share the same definition.

We natively support many datasets such as [Looker](https://www.askdata.com/datasets/looker) and [MicroStrategy](https://www.askdata.com/datasets/microstrategy), the full list here: [supported datasets](https://www.askdata.com/datasets/).
