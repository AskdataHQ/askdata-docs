    #### Q: Who is Askdata for?

Askdata is for everyone who wants a fast and reliable data access tool. Business users and small teams may like our messaging style groups, cross device apps and powerful data sharing options.

Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient. You can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace. 

Public groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.

Those looking for extra privacy should check out our enterprise solutions and rather revolutionary privacy policy. 

We keep evolving — follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/askdata_inc) and stay in touch.
