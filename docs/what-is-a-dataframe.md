    A daraframe is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular representation of data.

Data structure also contains labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like container for Series objects. 

Daraframe is a well known data structure popularized by Data Science tools like [pandas](https://www.askdata.com/knowledge-pills/what-is-pandas).
