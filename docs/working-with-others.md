## Integrated messaging workflow
-----------------------------

Users can **share** cards with other users through the platform's **internal messaging system**. Through the specific section accessible from the Home, users can access active conversations with other users.  

In the image below the user clicks on the “messages” icon to list his active conversations, then clicks on a specific conversation to read the history.
