## NLP PIPELINE

Every time a user interacts in Natural Language with the search pulling data from a specific Workspace 
the input token e.g. *"Give me revenue by regions‚Äù* is analyzed not by a single algorithm but by a sequence of [NLP algorithms] optimized for specific NLP tasks:

</p>


Specifically, the input is classified by the first algorithm and if it fails, the input passes through the second algorithm:

</p>


## Default pipeline: SmartIntent + Human2SQL

The default pipeline is composed by **SmartIntent** + **Human2SQL**.

**SmartIntent** is a machine learning classifier that recognize similarities between texts, giving a score between the input and all the possible outputs.
