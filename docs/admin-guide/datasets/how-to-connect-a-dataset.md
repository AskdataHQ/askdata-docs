    **Dataset configuration process:**

Open the **Askdata Console** and select one agent that you manage as admin.

In your **Agent Detail** section of the Agent to whom you want to configure.

Click on the [+] button close to the **Dataset** section and select the dataset type that you want to connect to the **Askdata Agent**.

Askdata natively supports different datasets: [list of supported dataset](/datasets)

Once the new dataset is added, you can click on the icon.

In the contextual menu select “Connection” to input the connection settings needed to establish a connection with data source.

Once you have completed you can simply press “Save”. Askdata will discover the dimensions (entities) and measures and build a knowledge graph that can be extended with synonyms and entity relationships over time.
