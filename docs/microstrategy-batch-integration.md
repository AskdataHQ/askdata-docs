The MicroStrategy REST API is a RESTful application that uses HTTP requests such as POST, GET, and DELETE. It is designed to help developers build data-driven client applications quickly and easily. It does this by providing light-weight JSON data that is easy to consume because it includes raw data without direct formatting. Developers can use the MicroStrategy REST API programmatically in their own code, or in a tool like curl.


**Pros:**


* Ideal for massive data interaction
* More aggregation functions availalbe due to the limited number of aggregation functions available through the MicroStrategy REST API framework
* MicroStrategy REST API licensing could not be available

**Cons:**


* Data is updated according to the frequency of the batch export
