The Askdata platform improves the way people interact with data.

## Definition of Dataset

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set) a dataset is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column of a table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given record of the data set in question.

## Definition of an Askdata dataset

We share the same definition.

Different datasets can be connected to one Askdata agent that will become the unique interface to easily deal with your own data.

We natively support many datasets such as **Looker** and **MicroStrategy**, the full list here: [supported datasets](https://www.askdata.com/datasets).
