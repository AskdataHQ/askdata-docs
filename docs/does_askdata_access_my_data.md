### Shared Cloud Environment

Askdata encrypt all keys and password to avoid any miusage nor authorized access to your data.
There is the option to opt-in to sharing anonymous usage data with us, which we use to make decisions about product improvements. 

#### Dedicated Cloud Environment

Protecting customer data is one of Askdataâ€™s highest priorities. Snowflake encrypts all customer data by default, using the latest security standards, at no additional cost. Snowflake provides best-in-class key management, which is entirely transparent to customers. This makes Snowflake one of the easiest to use and most secure data warehouses.

#### On-Premise

If you run Askdata as a self-hosted instance, none of your data is collected or stored on Askdata servers.
