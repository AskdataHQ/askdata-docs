    #### Minimum Hardware Requirements

The following minimum hardware requirements and recommendations apply to all computers running Askdata On-premise, including physical hardware and virtual machines (VMs):


* **Minimum requirements for testing and prototyping** are the minimum hardware your computer must have in order to install Askdata. These requirements are appropriate for testing and prototyping, but are not appropriate for most production environments.
* **Minimum recommendations for production** go beyond minimum requirements, and represent the minimum hardware configuration you should use for a production installation of Tableau Server. If your computer meets the minimum requirements but does not meet these recommendations

##### **Testing and Prototype instance**

**Note:** These minimum requirements are not recommended for use in production environments.

3 Kubernetes Cluster nodes:

8GB - 4 vCPU

##### **Production instance**

3 Kubernetes Cluster nodes (RAM 32GB - 4 vCPU)
