    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability for a computer to imitate human behavior by performing tasks that once required human make intelligence. AI allows machines to stimulate human intelligence by processing information, learning from that information, using reason to make decisions from the information its given, and self-correcting when it notices flaws in its reasoning or decision-making processes. Since computers have the ability to process information at rates that are impossible to humans, artificial intelligence’s ability to stimulate human intelligence means that computers can process massive amounts of data and complete tasks quicker and more efficiently than humans. AI allows companies to optimize processes and increase productivity by giving computers the ability to take over tasks that would be too-time consuming for humans to do.
