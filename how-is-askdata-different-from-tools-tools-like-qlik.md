    #### Q: How is Askdata different from tools like Qlik?

Unlike traiditional Business Intelligence, Askdata a platform-based with seamless data virtualization across across any device. As a result, you can access your data from several data-sources at once and share an unlimited number of data insights. 

Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Askdata is faster and way more secure. 

Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Askdata feeds and datasources. We also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Askdata, integrate any services.

And that‘s just the tip of the iceberg.
